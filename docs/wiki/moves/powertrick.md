# Power Trick

`move:powertrick` · Switches user's Attack and Defense stats.

## Definition

The user swaps its Attack and Defense stats, and stat stage changes remain on their respective stats. This move can be used again to swap the stats back. If the user uses Baton Pass, the replacement will have its Attack and Defense stats swapped if the effect is active. If the user has its stats recalculated by changing forme while its stats are swapped, this effect is ignored but is still active for the purposes of Baton Pass.
